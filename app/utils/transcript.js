Well, it's just that we've got that history test coming up. Do you want to study together? That would be great, but let me see. Saturday morning is no good. I'm playing football. It's the cup final, and I can't miss that. Of course not. Okay, so what about Friday night? I'm sorry, I can't. I'm busy. Dad's taking me to the sports center to watch the basketball game, but it doesn't finish until 10:00 p.m. Yeah, that's a bit late. Okay, how about Saturday afternoon? Any chance? Saturday afternoon? Saturday afternoon, it's my brother's birthday, so we're going to the restaurant to celebrate. You know, that new American diner on the High Street. Oh yeah, I've heard it's very good. What time do you think you're finished there? Probably about 5:00 p.m. But then I'm meeting Nathan. We're going to see the new Spider-Man film at the cinema. Hey, would you like to come? Spider-Man, not really my thing. So thanks, but no thanks. I guess that just leaves Sunday. Yeah, Sunday. Hmmm... That's a problem too. Why? Well, my grandparents are coming over, and we're taking them to that outdoor museum. Oh, the one with all the cool old buildings. That's right. My granddad loves that sort of stuff. I'd invite you, but I'm really sorry. We haven't got any room in the car. I don't want to see old buildings, Connor. I want to study for the test. Yeah, of course. Sunday evening, maybe, but only after 8:00 p.m. I've got a piano lesson from seven to eight, and we won't be back from the museum much before 6:00 p.m. No, that's too late. What about next weekend? I've got loads of free time next weekend. I'd love to, but there's a problem. What's that? The test is on Monday, this Monday, first thing in the morning.`
